# ZVcookies
This was a sample App made for my sister who was selling her home made cookies through instagram DM's. 

The app connects to a shopify backend using thier IOS connector and through this able to update storefront information dynamicly without client side updates

features that were planned for future iterations of this project are

- Guest accounts and verrified accounts being given diffrent user experiences
- Easy discount and price management from a companion Admin app
- sales infographics driven by shopify data and swiftcharts


Note: Due to the shopify account used in development being a trial version (which has now expired) the app cant make requests anymore so there is a branch that replaces callouts with Static Debug assets to simulate the use case of the app, do note that some functionality will not be completely reflective of what the app in its original for mwas

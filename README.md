# ZVcookies
This was a sample App made for my sister who was selling her home made cookies through instagram DM's. 

The app connects to a shopify backend using thier IOS connector and through this able to update storefront information dynamicly without client side updates

features that were planned for future iterations of this project are

- Guest accounts and verrified accounts being given diffrent user experiences
- Easy discount and price management from a companion Admin app
- sales infographics driven by shopify data and swiftcharts
